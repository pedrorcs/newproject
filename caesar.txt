O pardon me thon bleeding piece of eartrh
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liveed in the tide of times
Whoe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the lims of men
Domestic fury and fierece civil strife
